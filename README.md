# Linux Shell 

This is a simple Linux Shell made in C. 

## Running the shell

To run the shell, dowload the repository and navigate to the Makefile and run it

```
$make
```

Now you will see the falsh executable. To run it use ./ or you can also add it to your PATH

```
$./flash
```

or

```
$ export PATH=$PATH: falsh
```

To learn more about what falsh does, use the -h flag

```
falsh -h
```
